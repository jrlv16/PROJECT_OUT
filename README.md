# PROJECT_OUT

This project was made for beginners in Django

It's a simle example where I tried to use differents simple fields in models in order to explain how the MVT pattern works. I did the same with the views to explain the difference between FBV and CBV. Finaly in templates to show how to organize them I used extends and include  commands.
